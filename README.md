# PMA-for-Linux

PMA for Linux is a project aimed at Linux researchers and enthusiasts who want to learn the fundamentals of reverse engineering using modern, Linux-targeted examples and guided analysis.

Inspired by the book Practical Malware Analysis—widely regarded as one of the best resources for learning how to analyze malicious binaries—this project adapts the book’s structure for the Linux ecosystem. Each chapter is accompanied by:

A brief explanation of equivalent techniques in Linux

A custom ELF binary to analyze

Brief walkthroughs and answers

Disclaimer:
The binaries provided in this project are not identical to those in the original Practical Malware Analysis book. As such, the answers and solutions in the book may not directly apply here.
