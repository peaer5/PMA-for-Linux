#Chapter 15 - Anti Disassembling
Chapter 15 discusses anti-disassembling techniques. In short, these are methods that involve crafting assembly code in a way that exploits a disassembler's assumptions to hide malicious code.

Since these techniques target specific disassemblers rather than operating systems, there's no need to provide a detailed explanation in this context.

However, one notable exception is Structured Exception Handling (SEH), which is unique to Windows and has no direct equivalent in Linux. As a result, SEH-based anti-disassembly techniques are not applicable in our case.
