Chapter 14 discusses malware focused network signatures. In short, we studied how to develop effective network-based countermeasures, how to detect, prevent and response to network attacks.
The main goal is to be one step before the attacker, get familiar with the techniques he use and use the indicators from one malware to another in case it's the same author.

Since these techniques target network packets rather than operating systems, there's no need to provide a detailed explanation in this context.
